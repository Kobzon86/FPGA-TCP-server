# FPGA-TCP-server-
Simple TCP web-server to control Altera devboard using NIOS. Without using the NicheStack and MicroC stack.

In this project we will create a system based on the Nios II software processor, an Triple Speed Ethernet controller, an SGDMA controller, an SDRAM controller and other hardware components for transmitting and receiving TCP packets.
The software implementation of the ARP and TCP/IP protocols allows you to establish a connection with the board via HTTP, transfers an HTML page and closes the connection.

The board has a fixed IP, which is displayed on the LCD display after power is turned on.
